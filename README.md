# AerospaceBot

Cursor agent skills for aerospace engineering: checked formulas and small physics programs the bot can run and report, instead of reinventing equations or redrawing plots by hand.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`aero-formulas`](skills/aero-formulas) | Select and use verified aerospace formulas (compressible flow, atmosphere, rocket propulsion, aerodynamics, structures). Only formulas listed in `checks/check.md` are allowed. |
| [`ROCKET - Area-Mach Graph`](skills/ROCKET%20-%20Area-Mach%20Graph) | Run `area_mach.py` for an isentropic nozzle area-Mach curve, exit Mach from area ratio, exit pressure, ideal thrust, and expansion state. |
| [`ROCKET - PerformanceParameters`](skills/ROCKET%20-%20PerformanceParameters) | Run `performance.py` for frozen-CEA c*, temperature, gamma, ideal Cf, specific impulse, and density impulse. Do not call CEA at reply time. |

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` that tells the agent when to use it and how to respond.

    formulas.md          # formula reference
    checks/              # identity checks and allow-list
  ROCKET - Area-Mach Graph/
    SKILL.md
    area_mach.py         # nozzle area-Mach program (PNG + key: value stdout)
  ROCKET - PerformanceParameters/
    SKILL.md
    scripts/pairs.json   # propellant pairs, OF grids, density constants
    scripts/build_table.py  # offline CEA table builder
    src/load_table.py
    src/performance.py   # performance program (key: value stdout, optional PNG)
```

## Requirements

- **aero-formulas** — no extra runtime; the agent reads the markdown references.
- **ROCKET - Area-Mach Graph** — Python 3 with `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
- **ROCKET - PerformanceParameters** — Python 3 with `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Frozen tables are produced offline by `scripts/build_table.py` (`rocketcea`). A reply does not call CEA.

Example:

```bash
python "skills/ROCKET - Area-Mach Graph/area_mach.py" --gamma 1.25
python "skills/ROCKET - Area-Mach Graph/area_mach.py" --check
```

## Units

SI is the working system (Pa, m², N). Skills convert other units before calling programs and state the units used in the reply.
